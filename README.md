# Quantum-Enhanced-Federated-Learning-Project
The objective of this project is to create a Quantum-Enhanced Federated Learning Model for predictive diagnostics in healthcare, which includes multi-modal data processing (images and text), privacy-preserving protocols (differential privacy, homomorphic encryption), and the integration of neuro-symbolic AI for interpretability.
